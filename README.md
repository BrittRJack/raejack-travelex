## Milestone 2a Feedback
Nice job on your Milestone 2a! You have a plan for a simple, straight forward and effective personal website. I would say that your content doesn't seem very connected to the persona you desribed in your Milestone 1. Pivots make sense, and you can always add on more later, but the purpose of doing the person is to create a user to have in mind for your PWP and help direct the content you decide to add to it, so if you changed your target audience just be sure to think of who your new audience is. Also make sure to keep in mind the responsive nature of your site, which I have difficulty seeing in your wireframes - AKA how it will intuitively change from mobile to desktop and back.

Since part of your Milestone 2a got turned in after the deadline, but everything else in your content strategy looks good, your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier II. Good job!
