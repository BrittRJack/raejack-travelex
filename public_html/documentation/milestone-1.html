		<h1>Purpose of this site</h1>
		<p>I am creating this site geared towards women who have a desire to travel the world safely and independently.
		As a solo female traveller myself,<br> I understand the importance of having a strong community around me to feel
		that support. <br> As people of the world we all have that desire to experience new places, cultures and, food. We all deserve
		to feel safe and secure in our endeavors.</p>

		<h1>Audience</h1>
		<p>Single women who would like to travel but are letting fears and circumstances hold them back.</p>

		<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>The main goal is to unite single women who want to travel solo through this site by sharing my stories and experiences
		<br> of the do's and don't's and allow travel-seekers to ask questions and receive advice. </p>

		<br> traveling abroad.</p>
		<h2>Frustrations</h2>
		<p>Jenise gets impatient trying to search for content-specific travel blogs. In order to find the appropriate<br>
		blogs and articles, she has to filter through a ton of unrelated content. </p>
